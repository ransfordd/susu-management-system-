# Calendar-Based Monthly Cycle Implementation

## 📋 Overview

This implementation introduces a **calendar-based monthly cycle system** for tracking client Susu collections. Previously, the system used a fixed 31-day cycle regardless of the actual calendar month. The new system correctly handles monthly cycles based on calendar months (e.g., September 1-30, October 1-31, February 1-28/29).

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **CycleCalculator Class** (`includes/CycleCalculator.php`)

A comprehensive helper class that:
- ✅ Calculates completed cycles based on calendar months
- ✅ Allocates collections chronologically across months
- ✅ Uses overflow collections to complete incomplete cycles
- ✅ Provides detailed cycle breakdowns with daily collection data
- ✅ Returns summary statistics for client dashboards

**Key Methods:**
- `getCompletedCyclesCount($clientId)` - Returns number of completed cycles
- `calculateClientCycles($clientId)` - Calculates all monthly cycles
- `getDetailedCycles($clientId)` - Returns cycles with daily collection details
- `getCycleSummary($clientId)` - Returns comprehensive summary statistics
- `getCurrentCycle($clientId)` - Returns current active cycle

### 2. **Updated Client Dashboard** (`views/client/dashboard.php`)

- ✅ Integrated CycleCalculator for accurate cycle counting
- ✅ Made "Cycles Completed" card clickable
- ✅ Added new "Cycles Completed" action card
- ✅ Links to detailed cycles page

### 3. **Cycles Completed Page** (`client_cycles_completed.php`)

A beautiful, comprehensive page showing:
- ✅ Summary cards (Total Cycles, Completed, In Progress, Total Collected)
- ✅ Month-by-month cycle breakdown
- ✅ Progress bars for each cycle
- ✅ Collapsible daily collection details
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Responsive design with animations

### 4. **Migration Script** (`migrate_gilbert_cycles.php`)

A one-time migration script that:
- ✅ Finds Gilbert Amidu's collection data
- ✅ Re-allocates collections to calendar-based monthly cycles
- ✅ Updates day numbers to reflect proper cycle allocation
- ✅ Provides detailed logging and verification
- ✅ Admin-only access

### 5. **Test Suite** (`test_cycle_calculator.php`)

Comprehensive testing that verifies:
- ✅ Client lookup functionality
- ✅ CycleCalculator instantiation
- ✅ Cycle summary calculations
- ✅ Detailed cycle breakdowns
- ✅ September cycle completion (30/30)
- ✅ October cycle status (20/31)
- ✅ Overall system integrity

## 📊 How It Works

### Collection Allocation Logic

1. **Chronological Allocation**: Collections are allocated in chronological order
2. **Calendar-Based Months**: Each cycle corresponds to a calendar month
3. **Overflow Handling**: If a month isn't complete, collections from the next month are used to fill gaps
4. **Completion Criteria**: A cycle is "complete" when all days in that calendar month have been collected

### Example: Gilbert's Case

**Gilbert's Collections:**
- September 1-19: 19 collections
- October 1-31: 31 collections
- **Total**: 50 collections

**Allocation:**
- **September Cycle (Sep 1-30)**: Requires 30 days
  - Uses 19 collections from September
  - Uses 11 collections from October to complete
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (30/30)
  
- **October Cycle (Oct 1-31)**: Requires 31 days
  - Uses remaining 20 collections from October
  - **Status**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS (20/31)

**Result:**
- Total Cycles Completed: **1** (September)
- Current Cycle: October (20/31 collections)

## 🚀 Usage

### For Admins/Managers

1. **Run Migration** (one-time):
   ```
   http://your-domain/migrate_gilbert_cycles.php
   ```

2. **Verify Implementation**:
   ```
   http://your-domain/test_cycle_calculator.php
   ```

### For Clients

1. **View Dashboard**: The "Cycles Completed" card now shows accurate count
2. **Click Card**: Opens detailed cycles page
3. **View Details**: Click "View Daily Collections" to see breakdown

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] CycleCalculator class instantiates correctly
- [x] Correct cycle count calculation
- [x] Proper month allocation
- [x] September cycle shows as complete (30/30)
- [x] October cycle shows as incomplete (20/31)
- [x] Dashboard displays correct count
- [x] Cycles page loads without errors
- [x] Daily collections display correctly
- [x] Migration script runs successfully
- [x] Test suite passes all tests
- [x] No linter errors

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Admin/Manager authentication required for migration and test scripts
- ✅ Client authentication required for cycles page
- ✅ Prepared statements used throughout
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ XSS protection with `htmlspecialchars()`

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Cycles now match actual calendar months
2. **Transparency**: Clients can see detailed breakdowns
3. **Flexibility**: System handles months with different day counts
4. **Scalability**: Works for any number of clients and collections
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code
6. **User Experience**: Beautiful, intuitive interface

## 📝 Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Export cycle reports as PDF
- Email notifications when cycles complete
- Cycle comparison analytics
- Mobile app integration
- Automated cycle closure and payout triggers

## 🆘 Support

If issues arise:
1. Check test suite: `test_cycle_calculator.php`
2. Review migration logs: `migrate_gilbert_cycles.php`
3. Verify database schema matches expected structure
4. Check error logs for PHP errors
