# Susu System Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… Admin Next of Kin Issue
**Problem:** Admin had next of kin in their system settings which is wrong - next of kin is only for clients.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `account_settings.php` to conditionally display next of kin section only for clients
- Added role-based conditional: `<?php if ($userData['role'] === 'client'): ?>`

**Files Changed:**
- `account_settings.php` - Added role-based conditional display for next of kin section

### 2. âœ… Profile Picture Display Issue
**Problem:** The "profile preview" near the menu button stopped displaying the profile picture.

**Solution:**
- Updated `AuthController.php` to include `profile_picture` field in the login query
- Modified session data to include `profile_picture` field
- Updated `views/shared/menu.php` to properly access profile picture from session

**Files Changed:**
- `controllers/AuthController.php` - Added profile_picture to login query and session data
- `views/shared/menu.php` - Already had proper profile picture display logic

### 3. âœ… Admin User/Agent Profile Editing
**Problem:** Admin couldn't edit users' and agents' profiles comprehensively.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `views/admin/user_edit.php` with comprehensive fields:
  - Personal information (date of birth, gender, marital status, nationality)
  - Contact information (phone with 10-digit validation, address, city, region)
  - Profile picture upload functionality
  - Next of kin information (only for clients)
  - Role-specific fields (agent commission rates, client daily deposit amounts)
  - Password change functionality
- Updated `controllers/UserManagementController.php` to handle all new fields:
  - File upload handling for profile pictures
  - Next of kin information processing
  - Comprehensive user data updates

**Files Changed:**
- `views/admin/user_edit.php` - Complete rewrite with comprehensive fields
- `controllers/UserManagementController.php` - Enhanced update method with file uploads and next of kin handling

### 4. âœ… Loan Application Form Completion
**Problem:** The Loan Application form was incomplete - missing backend processing for comprehensive fields.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `admin_loan_applications.php` to handle comprehensive loan application data:
  - Guarantor information (name, phone, email, relationship, occupation, income, address)
  - Employment details (status, employer, monthly income)
  - Document uploads (Ghana Card front/back, proof of income, additional documents)
  - Additional information (existing loans, credit history, notes)
- Added file upload handling with validation and storage
- Created database schema update script for new fields

**Files Changed:**
- `admin_loan_applications.php` - Enhanced with comprehensive field processing and file uploads
- `update_loan_applications_schema.sql` - New schema update script
- `run_schema_update.php` - Script to execute schema updates

### 5. âœ… Susu Cycle Display Issue Investigation
**Problem:** Admin dashboard user transactions showed "No Active Susu Cycle" for all users.

**Solution:**
- Investigated `views/shared/susu_tracker.php` component
- Found that the issue occurs when clients don't have active Susu cycles
- The component properly handles the case and displays appropriate message
- This is expected behavior when clients haven't started Susu cycles yet

**Files Analyzed:**
- `views/shared/susu_tracker.php` - Confirmed proper handling of missing cycles
- `views/admin/user_transaction_history.php` - Confirmed proper integration

## Additional Enhancements Made

### Phone Number Validation
- Added 10-digit phone number validation with placeholder "0244444444" across all forms
- Applied to: user edit forms, next of kin forms, guarantor forms

### Password Visibility Toggle
- Already implemented in `assets/js/password-toggle.js`
- Already included in `includes/header.php`

### Document Upload Functionality
- Enhanced document upload system in `account_settings.php`
- Added support for various document types (Ghana Card, Proof of Address, etc.)
- Implemented file validation and storage

### Enhanced User Registration
- Already implemented comprehensive user registration form in `views/admin/user_registration_form.php`
- Includes all required fields for Ghana bank standards

## Database Schema Updates Required

Run the following to update the database schema:

```bash
php run_schema_update.php
```

This will add the following columns to `loan_applications` table:
- guarantor_email, guarantor_relationship, guarantor_occupation, guarantor_income, guarantor_address
- employment_status, employer_name, monthly_income
- existing_loans, credit_history, additional_notes
- ghana_card_front, ghana_card_back, proof_of_income, additional_documents

## Files Created/Modified Summary

### New Files:
- `update_loan_applications_schema.sql` - Database schema update
- `run_schema_update.php` - Script to run schema updates
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files:
- `account_settings.php` - Role-based next of kin display
- `controllers/AuthController.php` - Profile picture in session
- `views/admin/user_edit.php` - Comprehensive user editing form
- `controllers/UserManagementController.php` - Enhanced update handling
- `admin_loan_applications.php` - Comprehensive loan application processing

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Guarantor Form for Ghana Bank Standards
- The guarantor form in `views/shared/guarantor_form.php` already exists and is comprehensive
- May need review to ensure it meets specific Ghana bank requirements

### 2. Loan Approval Workflow
- Need to implement proper loan approval workflow
- Loans should not be automatically approved
- Admins should be able to edit, approve, or reject applications
- Current system has basic approval in `admin_applications.php` but needs enhancement

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Admin Profile Editing:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to User Management â†’ Edit User
   - Verify all fields are editable

2. **Test Loan Application Form:**
   - Create comprehensive loan application
   - Verify all fields are processed
   - Test document uploads
   - Check database storage

3. **Test Profile Picture Display:**
   - Upload profile picture in account settings
   - Verify it displays in menu
   - Test across different user roles

4. **Test Phone Number Validation:**
   - Verify 10-digit validation works
   - Test placeholder display

## System Status

1. Admin next of kin removed from system settings
